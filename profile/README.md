# posOpen

**posOpen** is an open, modular Point-of-Sale (POS) platform designed for small to medium businesses operating in the real world — including places with unreliable connectivity, limited budgets, and zero appetite for vendor lock-in.

This is not a monolith.
This is a platform.

## Why posOpen Exists

Modern POS systems are often:
- bloated with features nobody asked for,
- locked behind long-term licensing contracts,
- fragile in low-connectivity environments,
- hostile to developers and integrators.

posOpen takes the opposite approach.

We prioritise:
- **Simplicity over feature bloat**
- **Interoperability over proprietary silos**
- **Ownership over subscriptions**
- **Reliability over cleverness**

A POS should quietly do its job — even when the internet doesn’t.

## What We’re Building

posOpen is an **API-first, offline-capable POS foundation** that can be deployed as:

- Cloud-hosted
- On-premises
- Hybrid
- Offline-first (with sync and reconciliation)

### MVP Focus

The initial focus is intentionally narrow:

- Core sales transactions
- Product & pricing management
- Inventory tracking
- Cash & provider-agnostic payments
- Role-based user access
- Practical reporting (not analytics theatre)

If it can’t run a real shop on day one, it doesn’t ship.

## Design Principles

- **Open standards first**
- **Replaceable components**
- **Configuration over custom code**
- **API-first, UI-second**
- **Offline is a requirement, not a feature**
- **Shipping beats perfection**

Everything should be swappable without rewrites.

---

## Who This Is For

- Small and medium merchants
- Developers who want clean integration points
- System integrators operating in emerging markets
- Anyone tired of POS systems that fight back

---

## Project Status

posOpen is under **active development**.

This organisation hosts:
- core platform repositories,
- reference implementations,
- architecture decisions,
- pilot tooling and deployment assets.

Expect iteration. Expect change. Expect pragmatism.

---

## Contributing

We welcome contributors who value:
- clarity over cleverness,
- boring reliability,
- documentation that explains *why*, not just *how*.

Before contributing:
- keep proposals scoped to MVP goals,
- avoid enterprise complexity creep,
- justify decisions in terms of cost, simplicity, and maintainability.

If in doubt: make it smaller.

---

## Philosophy (In One Sentence)

A POS system businesses can **own**, developers can **extend**, and operators can **trust** — even when the lights flicker and the network drops.

---

Quietly powerful.
Open by design.
Built for reality.
